                    <p class="answer">
                        The concept for Whitespace is inspired by the Japanese philosophy The Pen and the Sword, the essential code of
                        a samurai warrior. Throughout the history of Japan, Samurai developed their physical martial arts while also
                        studying the softer skills of poetry, writing, and art. One discipline informs the other, and gives it perspective.

                    <p class="answer">
                        Tuition is $12,000 for a 15 week semester. This is an extremely competitive rate compared to other bootcamps and
                        helps ensure that we can attract the most talented teachers in the industry. Typical bootcamps around the country
                        cost around $1k per week and average 9-12 weeks. Our program is longer than average for the following reasons:
                        <ul>
                            <li>.Net is not quite as easy to pick up as languages like Ruby or PHP that a lot of other bootcamps teach</li>
                            <li>We have an intense design curriculum in place to make sure you are not only technically gifted but also able to build cohesive designs and talk the talk with other designers</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="answer">
                        No. We have a lot of confidence in our program and believe you should have confidence in yourself. Software Development jobs
                        are in high demand, but that doesn’t mean it is easy to get them! It will require dedicated effort both during
                        classes and after graduation to land you your entry level position. We partner with local companies to get you
                        the best chance of getting hired, but ultimately it is your tenacity and drive to succeed that will get you
                        to the next stage in your life.

                        A $1K downpayment is required when signing up and the rest is due on the first day of classes. Students do not
                        qualify for federal student aid for any software bootcamp, including Whitespace, but we are looking into other
                        options to give students more flexibility.

                        How likely is it for me to land a job after graduation?

                    <p class="answer">
                        Very likely. This obviously has a lot to do with how hard you work. The traits that will make you successful
                        in our bootcamp (passion, persistence, dedication) are also the traits that hiring companies look for.
                        Throw in the fact that we have partnerships with major hiring companies in the area and you have a
                        recipe for success.

                        A lot of other bootcamps teach Ruby or PHP, why do you teach .Net?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        .Net/C# is the most sought-after development language in the WNY region and most likely to net you a job.
                        It is also a fun language to work in and translates well to any other object-oriented language.

                        Why do you teach design with technology?

                    <p class="answer">
                        Understanding the elements and principles of design is learning a new language, the language that we
                        see and perceive with our eyes. Not only will you be able to make more intuitive and artistic software,
                        you will be able to communicate more effectively with other designers and artists in the field.
                        Use this new language of design to see the world in a new way and positively influence your life as a whole.

                        It is highly recommended that you have your own laptop running Windows 8. We do have some loaner laptops
                        available for students who cannot afford a laptop but they are honestly very old machines that we saved
                        from destruction just to have on hand for emergencies. Having your own laptop will also ensure that you
                        can continue your studies after graduation.

                    <p class="answer">
                        The biggest thing you gain from attending our class is learning to think like a developer and designer.
                        You will ‘learn how to learn’. Software development is constantly changing and if you don’t know how to
                        learn the newest language or framework your job will expire just as quickly. That being said, students
                        that graduate will receive a certification as a ‘Whitespace Ninja’ which means we are confident in your
                        skills to jump directly into an entry-level position, and will market you as such.

                        It is highly recommended that you forgo any other commitments during the bootcamp. You are making a huge
                        investment in your future which will take an equivalent portion of your time. Beyond in-class lessons,
                        code reviews, and lab hours there are also plenty of homework assignments and networking events.
